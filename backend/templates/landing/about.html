                Socially Wined is a wine discovery platform where real people track, rate, and share the wines they drink-no expertise required.

            <h2>Why We Built This</h2>
            <p>Wine can feel intimidating. Labels are confusing, ratings are inconsistent, and expert reviews don't always match real-world taste.</p>
            <p>Socially Wined was created to change that. Instead of telling you what you <em>should</em> like, we show you what people actually enjoy-friends, strangers, and fellow wine lovers.</p>
